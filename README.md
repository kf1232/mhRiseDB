Work in Progress

## Setup and Configuration
- Database: Microsoft SQL
- Languages: Javascript, MSSQL, HTML, CSS

1. Configure and run an instance of Microsoft SQL Server, with authorized login
2. Configure and run `npm install` for packages
3. Rename `.env copy` to `.env` and configure variables for `RO_*` and `LO_*` (read only and local)

## Roadmap
- Add first line (Kamura Weapons) of weapon data for each of the 14 weapon types
